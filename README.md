# BrainFlix

BrainFlix was a project completed during my time at BrainStation, providing hands-on experience with Sass (style rules, variables, mixins, etc.), Postman for API testing, and integrating APIs with a mock server. The application features responsive design across various breakpoints including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
